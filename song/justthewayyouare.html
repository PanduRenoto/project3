                <p>Oh, her eyes, her eyes</p>
                <p>Make the stars look like they're not shinin'</p>
                <p>Her hair, her hair</p>
                <p>Falls perfectly without her tryin'</p>
                <p>She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday</p>
                <p>Yeah, I know, I know</p>
                <p>When I compliment her, she won't believe me</p>
                <p>And it's so, it's so</p>
                <p>Sad to think that she don't see what I see</p>
                <p>But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"</p>
                <p>I say</p>
                <p>When I see your face</p>
                <p>There's not a thing that I would change</p>
                <p>'Cause you're amazing</p>
                <p>Just the way you are</p>
                <p>And when you smile</p>
                <p>The whole world stops and stares for a while</p>
                <p>'Cause girl, you're amazing</p>
                <p>Just the way you are</p>
                <p>Yeah</p>
                <p>Her lips, her lips</p>
                <p>I could kiss them all day if she'd let me</p>
                <p>Her laugh, her laugh</p>
                <p>She hates, but I think it's so sexy</p>
                <p>She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday</p>
                <p>Oh, you know, you know</p>
                <p>You know I'd never ask you to change</p>
                <p>If perfect's what you're searchin' for, then just stay the same</p>
                <p>So don't even bother askin' if you look okay</p>
                <p>You know I'll say</p>
                <p>When I see your face</p>
                <p>There's not a thing that I would change</p>
                <p>'Cause you're amazing</p>
                <p>Just the way you are</p>
                <p>And when you smile</p>
                <p>The whole world stops and stares for a while</p>
                <p>'Cause girl, you're amazing</p>
                <p>Just the way you are</p>
                <p>The way you are</p>
                <p>The way you are</p>
                <p>Girl, you're amazing</p>
                <p>Just the way you are</p>
