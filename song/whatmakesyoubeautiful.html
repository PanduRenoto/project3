            <div class="lyrics">
                <p>You're insecure, don't know what for</p>
                <p>You're turning heads when you walk through the door</p>
                <p>Don't need makeup to cover up</p>
                <p>Being the way that you are is enough</p>
                <p>Everyone else in the room can see it</p>
                <p>Everyone else, but you, ooh</p>
                <p>Baby, you light up my world like nobody else</p>
                <p>The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed</p>
                <p>But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell</p>
                <p>You don't know, oh-oh</p>
                <p>You don't know you're beautiful
                <p>If only you saw what I can see</p>
                <p>You'll understand why I want you so desperately</p>
                <p>Right now I'm lookin' at you, and I can't believe</p>
                <p>You don't know, oh-oh</p>
                <p>You don't know you're beautiful, oh, oh-oh</p>
                <p>That's what makes you beautiful</p>
                <p>So c-come on, you got it wrong</p>
                <p>To prove I'm right, I put it in a song</p>
                <p>I don't know why you're being shy</p>
                <p>And turn away when I look into your eyes</p>
                <p>Everyone else in the room can see it</p>
                <p>Everyone else, but you, ooh</p>
                <p>Baby, you light up my world like nobody else</p>
                <p>The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed</p>

                <p>You don't know you're beautiful, oh, oh-oh</p>
                <p>That's what makes you beautiful</p>
                <p>Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na</p>
                <p>Na-na-na, na-na-na</p>
