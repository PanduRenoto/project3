                <p>I can't be your love</p>
                <p>Look, it's too trivial for you now</p>
                <p>Oh my life is fallin' apart</p>
                <p>Maybe no one will notice if I disappear</p>
                <p>But I'll pray for you all the time</p>
                <p>If I could be by your side</p>
                <p>I'll give you all my life, my seasons</p>
                <p>I can't be your love</p>
                <p>'Cause I'm afraid I'll ruin your life</p>
                <p>While the leaves withered away</p>
                <p>And grew again</p>
                <p>You have gone far away</p>
                <p>I'll be pushing up daisies</p>
                <p>And bring all the chances to here</p>
                <p>But I'll pray for you all the time</p>
                <p>If I could be by your side</p>
                <p>I'll give you all my life, my seasons</p>
                <p>By your side, I'll be your seasons</p>
                <p>My love</p>
