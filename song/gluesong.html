                <p>I've never known someone like you</p>
                <p>Tangled in love, stuck by you from the glue</p>
                <p>Don't forget to kiss me or else you'll have to miss me</p>
                <p>I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue, oh, and you</p>
                <p>You've been hiding in plain sight, and it appeared, oh I know</p>
                <p>Loving you once only feels wrong, I need you</p>
                <p>I always knew I'd find you, to be here is worth the wait to</p>
                <p>I'm not lying when I say, "I've been stuck by the glue onto you"</p>
                <p>I've been stuck by glue</p>
                <p>Right onto you</p>
                <p>I've been stuck by glue</p>
